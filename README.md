# HW7_JusongCai

In this homework #7, I first soldered IMU (LSM6DS33:Data Sheet attached) separately and then wired it into breadboard to communicate with PIC32 via I2C. Finally I displayed the test bar both in vertical and horizontal directions to show accelerations of X and Y directions on LCD.

Steps include: check the communication by reading the WHOAMI register which should be 0b01101001 (decimal 105); write functions to be able to read registers in a row including temperature, gyroscope, and accelerometer data; read the IMU at 20Hz and blink your LED as a heartbeat; draw bars starting from the center of the LCD in the chip +X and +Y directions and scale the length of the bars to match the readings from the accelerometer; compile codes together: LCD communication named "ST7735.c" and "ST7735.h", IMU communication named "imc.h" and "imu.c", I2C communication named "i2c_master_noint.h" and "i2c_master_noint.c", and main coding function called "main.c".

After building the program, coding package folder "HW7.X" has been set up. Load the program to the board and make it run. So the result has been recorded as a "demo video for HW7.mp4". Other files like circuit diagram and breadboard wiring are also included in this repo. If you want to see more info about IMU, please check "LSM6DS33_Data_Sheet.pdf".
